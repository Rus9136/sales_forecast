## ML Forecasting System Implementation

### Session Overview
Implemented complete ML-based sales forecasting system with LightGBM, REST API, and admin panel integration.

### Tasks Completed

#### 1. Data Preparation Module ✅
**File**: `app/services/training_service.py`
- Created `TrainingDataService` class for ML data preparation
- Implemented feature engineering:
  - Time-based features: day_of_week, month, is_weekend, quarter, week_of_year
  - Rolling window features: 7/14/30-day averages and std
  - Lag features: previous day and week sales
  - Percentage change calculations
- Added data cleaning and NaN handling
- Time-based train/test split functionality

#### 2. ML Model Training & Forecasting ✅
**File**: `app/agents/sales_forecaster_agent.py`
- Created `SalesForecasterAgent` with LightGBM integration
- Model training with metrics (MAE, MAPE, R²)
- `forecast()` function for single predictions
- Model persistence with joblib (models/lgbm_model.pkl)
- Singleton pattern for efficient model management
- Feature importance analysis

#### 3. REST API Endpoints ✅
**File**: `app/routers/forecast.py`
- GET `/api/forecast/{date}/{branch_id}` - Single forecast
- GET `/api/forecast/batch` - Batch forecasts with filters
- GET `/api/forecast/comparison` - Compare predictions vs actuals
- GET `/api/forecast/export/csv` - CSV export functionality
- POST `/api/forecast/retrain` - Model retraining endpoint
- GET `/api/forecast/model/info` - Model metadata

#### 4. Admin Panel Integration ✅
**File**: `app/main.py` (Updated)
- Added "ПРОГНОЗ ПРОДАЖ" section in sidebar
- Three new pages:
  1. **Прогноз по филиалам**: Forecast table with date/branch filters
  2. **Сравнение факт/прогноз**: Accuracy analysis with sortable columns
  3. **Экспорт прогноза**: CSV export form with model info display
- JavaScript functions for:
  - Data loading and rendering
  - Table sorting by all columns
  - CSV export triggering
  - Model retraining from UI
- Consistent UI/UX with existing design
- Currency formatting: ₸ 231,000

### Technical Details

#### ML Pipeline
```
Raw Data → TrainingDataService → Feature Engineering → LightGBM Training → Model Persistence
                                                                    ↓
API Request → SalesForecasterAgent → Load Model → Generate Features → Predict → JSON Response
```

#### Feature Set (15 features)
- Temporal: day_of_week, month, day_of_month, is_weekend, quarter, week_of_year
- Binary flags: is_month_start, is_month_end
- Rolling stats: 7d/14d/30d averages, 7d std
- Lag features: 1d/7d sales history
- Change metrics: percentage change from previous day

#### Model Performance
- Configurable train/test split (default 80/20)
- Early stopping with 10 rounds
- Automatic feature importance logging
- Metrics tracked: MAE, MAPE, R², RMSE

### Files Created/Modified

**New Files**:
- `/app/services/training_service.py` - Data preparation service
- `/app/agents/sales_forecaster_agent.py` - ML model agent
- `/app/agents/__init__.py` - Package init
- `/app/routers/forecast.py` - Forecast API endpoints
- `/test_model_training.py` - Model training test script
- `/test_forecast_api.py` - API testing script
- `/test_forecast_ui.py` - UI functionality test script

**Modified Files**:
- `/app/services/__init__.py` - Added training service export
- `/app/routers/__init__.py` - Added forecast router
- `/app/main.py` - Added forecast router and UI pages
- `/requirements.txt` - Added joblib dependency
- `/CLAUDE.md` - Updated with ML system documentation

### Testing & Validation

1. **Model Training Test**:
   ```bash
   python test_model_training.py
   ```
   - Trains model on historical data
   - Displays metrics and feature importance
   - Tests single forecast function

2. **API Testing**:
   ```bash
   python test_forecast_api.py
   ```
   - Tests all forecast endpoints
   - Provides curl examples
   - Validates response formats

3. **UI Testing**:
   ```bash
   python test_forecast_ui.py
   ```
   - Checks model status
   - Lists UI navigation paths
   - Provides testing checklist

### Production Deployment

```bash
# Rebuild containers
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml build --no-cache sales-forecast-app

# Deploy
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d

# Verify
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml logs -f sales-forecast-app
```

### Key Features Delivered

1. **Automated ML Pipeline**: Complete from data prep to predictions
2. **Real-time Forecasting**: API responds with predictions instantly
3. **Model Management**: Save/load/retrain capabilities
4. **Accuracy Tracking**: Compare predictions with actuals
5. **Data Export**: CSV downloads for external analysis
6. **User-friendly UI**: Integrated seamlessly into existing admin panel
7. **Production Ready**: Dockerized with proper error handling

### Performance Considerations

- Model loaded once at startup (singleton pattern)
- Batch predictions optimized for multiple branches/dates
- Rolling features calculated efficiently per department
- CSV export streams data without loading all into memory

### Security & Error Handling

- Input validation for dates and branch IDs
- Graceful handling of insufficient historical data
- Detailed error logging with tracebacks
- HTTP status codes for different error types

### Next Possible Enhancements

1. Schedule automatic model retraining (daily/weekly)
2. Add more sophisticated features (holidays, promotions)
3. Implement ensemble models for better accuracy
4. Create forecast confidence intervals
5. Add real-time forecast monitoring dashboard
6. Implement A/B testing for model versions
7. Add forecast explanations (SHAP values)
8. Create mobile-responsive forecast views

### Session Summary

Successfully implemented a complete ML forecasting system from scratch, including data preparation, model training, REST API, and full admin panel integration. The system is production-ready with proper error handling, logging, and user-friendly interface. All components follow the project's existing patterns and coding standards.
